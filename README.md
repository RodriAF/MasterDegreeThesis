# Comparation of Time Series Forecasting and Machine Learning for Weather Prediction
In this repository I´m sharing my Master´s Degree Thesis I´m currently doing about a comparation of predicting weather with Time Series Forecasting and Machine Learning with R.

## Dataset
The data used is from the public database of weather from Spain kept in [AEMET API] (https://opendata.aemet.es/centrodedescargas/inicio).
